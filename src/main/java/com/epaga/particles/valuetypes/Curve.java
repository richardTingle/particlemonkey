  /**
   * Adds a control point to the curve. The line will enter the control point with the following
   * rules but may curve between control points so a continuous line is formed.
   *
   * Note that if the implied gradient entering the control point is different from the implied gradient exiting it then
   * the gradient may sharply change (but the line itself will remain continuous).
   *
   * Between each pair of control points acts as an independent cubic Bézier-like curve defined by the following:
   *
   * anchor 1 - the 'point' of the first control point (the line will pass through this point)
   * intermediate point 1 - the 'out' of the first control point (the line may not go through this point but it controls the initial direction the line exits anchor 1)
   * intermediate point 2 - the 'in' of the second control point (the line may not go through this point but it controls the initial direction the line enters anchor 2)
   * anchor 2 - the 'point' of the second control point (the line will pass through this point)
   *
   * Instinctively you can think of each section "trying" to go from anchor 1 -> intermediate point 1 -> intermediate point 2 -> anchor 2
   * but being smoothed using a quadratic curve such that it may not actually touch the intermediate points.
   *
   * Note; if this is the first control point the in doesn't matter and if its the last control point the out doesn't matter
   * 
   * Note; these are Bézier-like curve but not Bézier curves due to the requirement that X must always move forwards
   * (as it often represents time)
   *
   * @param in
   *          the intermediate point immediately before this anchor point.
   *          This is a control point in Bézier curve terminology
   * @param point
   *          the line will pass through this point. This is an anchor point in Bézier curve terminology
   * @param out
   *          the intermediate point immediately after this anchor point.
   *          This is a control point in Bézier curve terminology
   * @return this curve
